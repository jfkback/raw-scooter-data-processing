# raw-scooter-data-processing

Script that can turn raw downloaded dockless scooter json data into more usable data. For example, the raw jsons give the location of each scooter at a given time, but as each is only a snapshot tracking the path of scooters is difficult. Using this script the scooter locations can be easily tracked. A couple other interesting features include latitude and longitude discretization for easier predictive modeling. The zoning regulation can also be found with the included json file for other locations a different json will have to be provided.
